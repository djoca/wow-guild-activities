+ INTRODUCTION

This is a node.js program that uses Blizzard API to make a little summary of the guild activities and, optionally, send it to an e-mail address.

Right now, this service only shows member achievements.

+ USAGE

There are 3 main node files. Each one of them should be executed with a node.js executable.

- metadata.js

Load some almost static data and saves it on disk for later use by summary.js

This is the first and required step. This program can be called only once and should be called again when a new race, class or achievement is created.

- summary.js: 

Invokes Blizzard API, looking for new activities. The activities are saved as summary.html.

To use the summary.js program, you need to create a file named summary-config.json with your configurations. This file should look as:

{
  "realm": "Tol Barad",
  "guild": "Gratenoineg Canaldaça"
}

- mail-sender.js

Send the summary.html previously created to an e-mail address.

To use the mail-sender.js program, you need to create a file named mail-config.json with your mailing configuration. This file should look as:

{
  "from": "mail@mail.com",
  "to": "joe@email.com",
  "smtpUser": "mail@mail.com",
  "smtpPass": "secret"
}
